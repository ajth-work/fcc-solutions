        <p>We are Dan (Mokichi) and AJ (sonsolo), two Assistant Language Teachers in the Kansai region of Japan. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Dan mainly handled content creation and verifying the accuracy of the information. Dan likes puppies and
            long walks along the beach. His favourite ramen is miso ramen.</li>
          <li>AJ mainly handled data management and wrestling with Memrise. “A world without spaghetti is no world to
            me”. “Ramen, tsk, it’s just spaghetti in soup”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We’re from the UK and the US, respectively, so you may notice an unintentional overlap of British English and
          American English. </p>
        <p> We've spent 5 months developing the course contents, learning the ins and outs of importing into the Memrise
          database system, surveying and consulting with many Japanese citizens, visiting museums and more, in order to
          create a complete learning experience. </p>
        <p>This course was originally created to enable the learning of all the Jōyō kanji (常用漢字) not taught on
          WaniKani. The resource was then expanded to cover kanji that could appear in the JLPT N1 test.</p>
        <p>All pre-existing mnemonics in the course are original content created by Dan and AJ.</p>
        <p>If you feel like this course helped you to reach a better understanding of Japanese or helped you to pass the
          JLPT and you want to give back, we are currently looking into ways for you to show your appreciation. </p>

        <header id="Our_Method"><b>Our Method</b></header>
        <p>A list of required kanji was created using the available data on "http://peterkinnaird.eu/kani/#kanji" which
          shows a list of "N1" kanji not taught on WaniKani.</p>
        <p>A further list was created using data from "https://www.wkstats.com/#charts.joyo" which expressly states the
          "173 of 2136 Jōyō kanji not yet covered by WaniKani."</p>
        <p>After cross-referencing the two lists and removing any duplicate kanji, a final list of the kanji to be
          studied was created.</p>
        <p>Every kanji on that final list had its associated meaning and readings collected and documented. The meanings
          used were the meanings given on: "www.jisho.org".</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Note: There are some kanji which aren't part of either list however these were added due to be found in
            the vocabulary used in our content. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The "on" and "kun" readings were taken from a document created by the Japanese "Agency for Cultural Affairs"
          available here:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>"http://www.bunka.go.jp/kokugo_nihongo/sisaku/joho/joho/kijun/naikaku/kanji/index.html”. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>For any kanji not contained in this document, a different method was employed. The "on" and "kun" readings
          were taken from "http://kanji.jitenon.jp/" checked further with "https://kotobank.jp/word/" and with the pièce
          de résistance of having between 23 to 46 native Japanese speakers surveyed, confirming the readings. </p>
        <p>Almost every kanji on this list has associated vocabulary for various parts of speech such as nouns or
          adjectives. The Jōyō kanji had several associated vocabulary published in the Jōyō Chart (常用表) document
          mentioned above. The majority of these were used in this resource.</p>
        <p>For the kanji not contained, again, a different method was used. The kanji was searched on "www.jisho.org"
          and the most useable (in some cases, only available) vocabulary containing that kanji was placed into an
          online questionnaire. This questionnaire was distributed to upto 46 native Japanese speakers who stated
          whether they knew the vocabulary or not, and also added any additional vocabulary they thought might be
          useful. The questionnaire data was then analysed with the results sorted from well recognised vocabulary to
          poorly recognised vocabulary.</p>
        <p>After ordering the vocabulary from most usable to least, the most useable was placed into the various units
          that comprise the memrise course.</p>
        <p>All kanji have a meaning mnemonic, and where relevant, an on-reading mnemonic and/or kun-reading mnemonic.
        </p>
        <p>The meaning mnemonic uses WaniKani radicals as well as several "compound radicals" (generally a standalone
          kanji like 龍 being used in 籠). <b>Please feel free to make your own mnemonics.</b></p>
        <p>Many of the different parts of speech have a mnemonic included where the reading may slightly differ to the
          basic "on/kun" readings.</p>
        <p>Several of the mnemonics may be a little "NSFW" including swear words or vulgar imagery, so please bear that
          in mind as you study.</p>

        <p>The kanji list is split into 6 primary units and each unit contains 60 kanji.
          <p>For each unit, there are 11 separate Memrise levels that cover the following:</p>
          <ul>

      <section id="Mnemonics_Breakdown" class="main-section">
        <header id="Mnemonics_Breakdown"><b>Mnemonics Breakdown</b></header>
        <p>The Basics</p>
        <p>Mnemonics are essentially sentences that use supporting material to build a memory around some target
          material. Mnemonics are referred to as “mems” on Memrise. You can read about Memrise’s information on
          mnemonics here. </p>
        <p>Our course’s mnemonics generally follow a similar format. Due to the limitations of Memrise and being unable
          to use different colours for fonts, we use brackets () (American English: “parentheses”) to differentiate
          between supporting material and the target material. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Supporting Material is capitalized within brackets.</li>
          <li>Target Material is capitalized without brackets.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Kanji</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Example: 柿</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Our mnemonic: “The only (TREE) in this (CITY) is a PERSIMMON tree.” </li>
            <li>In this example, the target material is the meaning, “PERSIMMON”, for the kanji 「柿」.</li>
            <li>In this example, the supporting materials are (TREE) and (CITY),
              <ul>
                <li>(TREE) and (CITY) are the “associated meanings” for the two radicals (木 and 市) that constitute the
                  target material’s kanji「柿」.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Notice, the supporting materials, (TREE) and (CITY), are capitalized within brackets, and the target
              material, “PERSIMMON”, is capitalized without brackets.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>

        <p>Vocabulary</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Example: 曖昧 </li>
          <ul>
            <li>Our mnemonic: “An idea that's (NOT CLEAR) and (FOOLISH) is VAGUE and AMBIGUOUS.”</li>
            <li>In this example, the target material is the meaning, “VAGUE and AMBIGUOUS”, for the vocabulary term,
              「曖昧」.
            </li>
            <li>In this example, the supporting materials are (NOT CLEAR) and (FOOLISH).
              <ul>
                <li>(NOT CLEAR) and (FOOLISH) are the “primary meanings” for the two kanji (曖 and 昧) that constitute the
                  target material’s vocabulary term 「曖昧」.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Notice, the supporting materials, (NOT CLEAR) and (FOOLISH), are capitalized within brackets, and the
              target
              materials, “VAGUE and AMBIGUOUS”, are capitalized without brackets.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>

        <p>“ON-reading” and “KUN-reading” mnemonics</p>
        <p>There is a variety of styles used in writing the reading mnemonics. Whilst the majority follow a
          particular
          writing convention, there are exceptions. These exceptions are primarily down to creating what we believe
          to
          be the “easiest” way to remember the reading.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Example of regular mnemonic - format 1: 苛烈 (A008)</li>
          <ul>
            <li>If you don't eat your かれつ(CARROTS) there will be a SEVERE punishment.</li>
            <li>In this example the reading of the word, written in hiragana, comes BEFORE the English word being used
              to
              remember it. The target meaning for the vocabulary is in CAPITAL LETTERS without any brackets.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>Example of regular mnemonic - format 2: 謁 (K013)</li>
          <ul>
            <li>My ETCH(えつ)-a-sketch skills got me an AUDIENCE WITH the king.</li>
            <li>The only difference for format 2 is that the reading of the word, written in hiragana, comes AFTER the
              English word being used to remember it. Again the target meaning is in CAPITAL LETTERS without any
              brackets.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>Example of an exception: 謔 (K027) </li>
          <ul>
            <li>The ぎゃく(逆) of being a scrooge is being a SPORT WITH a joke.</li>
            <li>In this example the reading of ぎゃく doesn’t lend itself to any decent mnemonics through being similar to
              an English word. However, the same reading is used for the bracketed (逆). So, the mnemonic uses the
              meaning
              of 逆 which is taught on WaniKani.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>

        <p>We organized and tested our database to work inside Memrise exceedingly well, but we aren’t perfect. </p>
        <p>Let us know at afterlife.kanji@gmail.com if there are any issues you come across as you use our course.</p>
        <p>We created an external database within Google Sheets and we imported our information into Memrise’s database
          system.</p>
        <p>If you weren’t already aware, within the Memrise database system, there are two types of columns:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>“Columns”</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Essentially, this is for testable content, such as Term, Meaning, or Reading. </li>

        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>“Attributes”</li>
          <ul>

          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>As for our Memrise course’s overall database structure, we have the following “Columns”:</p>

          <li>TERM</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Typically, a kanji or vocabulary word.</li>
